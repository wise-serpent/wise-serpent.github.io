Power Brokering
===============

Power is insidious. When we do not possess it, we see power as freedom. Yet as Solomon reminds us, one official is eyed by a higher one, and over them both are others higher still. If one were elected to the Senate, taking a stance would be no easy matter. Fail to play nicely with the other senators, and one get no committees, no sway -- why do the few independent senators chose to caucus with one of the parties?. Be enough of a thorn, and one's state can be locked out of federal money. And what good is one doing then, assuming one could even stay elected?

Yet this surely this is the path to compromise with evil, seeking to cling to power that one may do some little good while inflicting evil left and right.

It takes great courage to determine to do what is right, whether with much power or little. To honor God even when it will be scorned by both one's bosses and the masses. The eyes of the Lord may roam the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him -- but do we dare fully trust in him and cast aside our dependence on man?

Be shrewd, my daughter, like the snake. Love the Lord.
