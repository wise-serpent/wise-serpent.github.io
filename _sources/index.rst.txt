Welcome to Agur's Blog!
=======================

You can learn a bit more about me under :ref:`about`, read my recent posts, or see what I've written on a particular topic. I write primarily for my children to be wise in the years to come and secondarily for others. My goal is to publish a post once a week. Feel free to leave a comment, especially if you disagree. My comment policy is pretty simple:

1. Be respectful.
2. Write to persuade the opposition, not preach to the choir. Perhaps not the completely-corrupts-lying-through-their-teeth-with-no-hope-of-redemption opposition, but at least the misguided-and-perhaps-more-corrupt-than-they-realize-opposition [#treatment]_.
3. When in doubt, see rule 1.

.. `toctree` directive, below, contains list of non-post `.rst` files.
   This is how they appear in Navigation sidebar. Note that directive
   also contains `:hidden:` option so that it is not included inside the page.

   Posts are excluded from this directive so that they aren't double listed
   in the sidebar both under Navigation and Recent Posts.

Footnotes
---------

.. [#treatment] As a rule of thumb, the opposition [#me]_ does not respond to being misrepresented, mocked, ignored, called stupid, or having real points replaced with strawmen.

.. [#me] At least I don't. My opposition might be inhuman monsters who aren't like me at all in this regard, but since most of them still have 10 toes, 10 fingers, 2 eyes, a nose, and a mouth, it's probably better to assume they are more-or-less human.
