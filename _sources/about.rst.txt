About Agur
==========

Long ago, it was written [#proverbs30]_:

  The man declares, I am weary, O God;
  I am weary, O God, and worn out.
  Surely I am too stupid to be a man.
  I have not the understanding of a man.
  I have not learned wisdom,
  nor have I knowledge of the Holy One.

  Who has ascended to heaven and come down?
  Who has gathered the wind in his fists?
  Who has wrapped up the waters in a garment?
  Who has established all the ends of the earth?
  What is his name, and what is his son's name?
  Surely you know!

  Every word of God proves true;
  he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.
  Do not add to his words,
  lest he rebuke you and you be found a liar.

I write reflections about the application of scripture to daily life.

I write that my children may fear the Lord more than most, treasure wisdom, and be as shrewd as a snake. Innocent as a dove? That's why they have a mother.
